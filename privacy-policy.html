        <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>This website uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience and to display advertisements. This page
            explains how we use cookies and how you can control them.</p>

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to
            make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners.</p>

        <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preference cookies:</strong> These cookies remember your preferences and settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our
                website.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to display relevant advertisements and
                track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Google AdSense and Third-Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google AdSense uses cookies to serve ads
            based on your previous visits to our website and other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables
            it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet.</p>

        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads"
                target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</p>

        <h2>Chrome's Third-Party Cookie Phase-Out</h2>
        <p>Google Chrome is gradually phasing out support for third-party cookies to enhance user privacy. This affects
            how advertising works on our website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party cookies from services like Google AdSense will be limited or blocked by default in Chrome
            </li>
            <li>We're adapting by implementing privacy-friendly alternatives like the Privacy Sandbox APIs</li>
            <li>We collect first-party data (information directly shared with our website) to provide relevant content
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>First-Party Data Collection</h2>
        <p>When you consent to advertising cookies, we collect the following first-party data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Page context (URL, title, referrer)</li>
            <li>Device information (viewport size, device type)</li>
            <li>Visit time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties except as necessary for ad
            serving.</p>

        <h2>Managing cookies</h2>
        <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. You can delete all cookies that are already on your device
            and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. However, if you do this, you may have to
            manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site, and some services and functionalities may not
            work.</p>

        <p>To change your cookie settings on our website, you can <button id="open-cookie-settings"
                style="background-color: #4a76a8; color: white; border: none; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer;">click
                here</button> to reopen the cookie consent banner.</p>

        <script>
            // Add functionality to reopen cookie settings
            document.getElementById('open-cookie-settings').addEventListener('click', function () {
                // Show the cookie banner again
                document.getElementById('cookie-consent-banner').style.display = 'block';
            });
        </script>
